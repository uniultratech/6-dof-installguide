# 6-DOF-Install-Guide
The 6 DOF Robot arm is a professional project, the installation does require some patience and familarity with using tools. This is also a DIY project, there are many different ways you can assemble this project, this guide is just the standard way, you don't have to follow this guide if you have your own ideas. However, if you do decide to follow the guide, please make sure that you read this install guide thoroughly and follow step by step. If you have any queries about the installation, feel free to contact us at www.uniultratech.com/contact.

## Step 1: Install the base
First look for the two base pieces and 2 sets of screws with the corresponding nuts. (although there are many holes to put screws in, two sets is enough in securing the base. You can choose to add more later).

Next, find a servo and 4 sets of screws with the corresponding nuts and washers(washers are needed because the holes for servos are bigger than the heads of the screws) You will also need 4 other individual screws to assemble the turning plate for the servo.(You can't find the correct 4 holes turning plate along with the servo bag. The turning plate of the server is provided in a separate bag along with some screws. They might be silver, but the graph we use has black turning plates)

## Step 2: Assemble the Arm
Take your prepared server mount and assemble it onto your server. Take another servo bracket, use the 4 screws we prepared previously to mount that bracket onto the base servo. Make sure the orientation of the bracket looks like the following. (***NOTICE:*** you might need to turn your servo around to make sure that it can successfuly turn to the range you want it to. Feel free to adjust degree of the servo and than assemble the bracket on top.)

Next, take a big head screw provided in the bag of the servo, and screw it through the center of the servo. Also take out one of the arm pieces with one set of screw along with nuts and a bearing. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87834727-fa890500-c83f-11ea-96f7-5087fc473576.jpg)

Take the bearing and put it through the big hole of at either the side of the arm piece. Also put a screw through one of the center holes from your servo braket like the graph

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87834729-fb219b80-c83f-11ea-9593-37b72c5f60dc.jpg)

Then assemble the arm piece to the servo bracket by putting the screw through the bearing like how the graph is showing. Take a nut and screw it onto the screw. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87834732-fb219b80-c83f-11ea-87f6-335f6a38c6d4.jpg)

Now we are going to assemble the second servo onto the servo bracket. Take out a servo and 4 sets of screws with washers and nuts. A 4 holes servo turning plate and another 4 screws for the servo turning plate. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87834733-fb219b80-c83f-11ea-98e9-81adb5ac6290.jpg)

Then, you want to assemble the servo onto the servo braket. Notice the servo oreintation on the graph. Assemble the other side of the arm piece onto the servo turning plate, and screw the servo turning plate onto the servo. Now you need a big head servo turning plate screw like indicating in the graph. Screw that screw through the center of the servo turning plate into the turning hole of the servo. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87834734-fbba3200-c83f-11ea-8fe9-e0dc3d11e598.jpg)

Take out the other arm piece from your kit and 4 sets of screws with nuts. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87834736-fbba3200-c83f-11ea-964e-23e10db84a5e.jpg)

Assemble the two arm pieces head to head or (tail to tail if that is the way we want to call it) using the 4 screw sets that we took out like the picture below. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87834737-fc52c880-c83f-11ea-9f31-d6277dd43c78.jpg)

Next take out another servo bracket along with the 90 degree piece mount for our claw. 4 sets of screws with nuts, 4 screws, and 1 screw with a bearing and a nut. And another arm connector piece

Next, assemble the arm piece onto the 90 degree L piece. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87861445-2c12d680-c8fb-11ea-840d-b537bce06e70.jpg)

Next, put the servo turning plate onto the servo and place the servo into the bracket like the image (Do not screw any screws for servo yet, just place it in there like the graph. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87861449-2d440380-c8fb-11ea-9eb4-80290bc6cb29.jpg)

Then screw in the 4 screws through the 4 holes of the arm piece into the 4 holes from the servo turning plate. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87861451-2d440380-c8fb-11ea-9224-8dfc99a22a3e.jpg)

Last part is to screw in a big head screw in the center of the servo, and the set of 4 screws with nuts and washers into the shoulder holes of the servo onto the bracket. 

### Step 3: Assemble the wrist part

First, you need to take out two servo brackets, and 4 sets of screws with nuts.

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87861965-2ff52780-c900-11ea-9363-89dcb1c1782a.jpg)

Conect the two bracket back to back in a cross orientation like the image.

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87861966-308dbe00-c900-11ea-85f0-921fe8d1c26f.jpg)

Prepare 1 set of screw with nut and bearing. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87861967-31265480-c900-11ea-940b-1510a125dbba.jpg)

Place the bracket you just assembled into middle of the arm piece like the graph. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87861968-31beeb00-c900-11ea-9d17-e10e11042cae.jpg)

Next, put in the set of screw with nut and bearing through the center hole from the bracket and the arm.

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87861970-32578180-c900-11ea-82b0-4f1d2d3a0e2e.jpg)
![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87861971-32578180-c900-11ea-95c0-5f837962e31e.jpg)

Now let's take out a servo and 4 sets of screws no nuts needed. Also take out a 4 hole turning plate. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87861972-32f01800-c900-11ea-89e6-d34feedbad3b.jpg)

Place the servo into the bracket, and screw in the 4 screws through the arm piece into the 4 holes of the servo turning plate. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87861973-32f01800-c900-11ea-8800-8668e5903332.jpg)

Take a big head screw and screw it in the servo center turning piece through the big hole of the arm piece. Also, you would need to screw in the servo into the shoulder
part of the bracket using 4 screws with nuts and washers. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87861974-3388ae80-c900-11ea-9d23-ed3dcef66e8e.jpg)

Now, we can take out another servo and screw it into the top bracket with 4 sets of screws and nuts with washers. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87861975-3388ae80-c900-11ea-9937-7ce9684bbeee.jpg)
![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87861976-34214500-c900-11ea-89e8-f150d0f023b4.jpg)


### Step 4: Assemble the Claw

Take out the claw piece, 1 servo, 1 servo turning plate, and 6 screws. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87834715-f8bf4180-c83f-11ea-95c0-590e2fd661f3.jpg)

Place the servo turning plate on the turning part of the claw, make sure you leave the part that connects the servo facing up so that we can assemble the servo onto it. See image for the orientation: 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87834717-f957d800-c83f-11ea-876e-f457e657e2f8.jpg)

Next, put the servo onto the four stands supporting servo, make sure your servo turning plate is attached to the servo head. See below images for orientation. 

![alt text](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68445659/87834718-f957d800-c83f-11ea-8e8d-7ee37d8a3c4f.jpg)

Screw in the 4 screw with washers through the shoulders of the servo onto the four stands.
